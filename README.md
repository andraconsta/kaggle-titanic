This is the classic Titanic Kaggle Dataset. I predict who lives and dies based on simple data engineering.


# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This project is a solution to the Titanic Kaggle competition, which involves predicting the survival of passengers on the RMS Titanic.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender, class, and other socio-economic factors.

## Files in this Repository

- `train.csv` - The training dataset used to build the model.
- `test.csv` - The test dataset used for making predictions.
- `titanic_analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the entire analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation process.
- `submission.csv` - The final predictions for the test dataset, ready for submission to Kaggle.
- `dataframe_titanic_report.html` - An exploratory data analysis (EDA) report generated using Pandas Profiling.

## Steps to Run the Project

### Final Reflections & Lessons Learned
ðŸŽ¯**Feature Engineering is Key**: The importance of feature engineering became evident throughout this project. Creating new features like FamilySize and IsAlone significantly improved model performance.

ðŸŽ¯**Handling Missing Data**: Understanding the impact of missing data and deciding how to handle it is crucial. I learned that different imputation strategies could lead to varying results.

ðŸŽ¯**Model Selection and Tuning**: Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms and fine-tuning their hyperparameters is essential for achieving the best performance. Ensemble methods like Random Forest and advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting can often provide better results.

ðŸŽ¯**Cross-Validation**: Relying solely on a single train-test split can be misleading. Cross-validation offers a more reliable way to assess model performance and avoid overfitting.
