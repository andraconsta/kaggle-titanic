This is the classic Titanic Kaggle Dataset. I predict who lives and dies based on simple data engineering.


# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This project is a solution to the Titanic Kaggle competition, which involves predicting the survival of passengers on the RMS Titanic.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender, class, and other socio-economic factors.

## Files in this Repository

- `train.csv` - The training dataset used to build the model.
- `test.csv` - The test dataset used for making predictions.
- `titanic_analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the entire analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation process.
- `submission.csv` - The final predictions for the test dataset, ready for submission to Kaggle.
- `dataframe_titanic_report.html` - An exploratory data analysis (EDA) report generated using Pandas Profiling.
